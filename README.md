backbone.js-example
===================

I just name it as backbone.js as my motive at the beginnning was to develop 
simple sample app using backbone.js. I will rename it soon.

Now, I am thinking it to use all the cutting edge technology using to build full web stack app using PHP and Javscript. 

It will be just simple app having few features using following tools and APIs. 

Grunt - Node.js based task runner 
Behat - BDD
Qunit and PhantomJs - For Javascript Unit Test
PHP Unit - Unit Test for PHP
Composer - PHP Package Manager
PHP SPL Classes 
Object Relation Mapper - TBD
MySql - Data storage
Bootstrap - For UI
Backbone and Jquery - Javascript Framework and Library respec.
