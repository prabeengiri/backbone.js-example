backbone.js-example
===================

I just name it as backbone.js as my motive at the beginnning was to develop 
simple sample app using backbone.js. I will rename it soon.

Now, I am thinking it to use all the cutting edge technology using to build full web stack app using PHP and Javscript. 

It will be just simple app having few features using following tools and APIs. 

1. Grunt - Node.js based task runner 
2. Behat - BDD
3. Qunit and PhantomJs - For Javascript Unit Test
4. PHP Unit - Unit Test for PHP
5. Composer - PHP Package Manager
6. PHP SPL Classes 
7. Object Relation Mapper - Doctrine
8. MySql - Data storage
9. Bootstrap - For UI
10. Backbone and Jquery - Javascript Framework and Library respec.
